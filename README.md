## Short description of the idea (140 character tweet):

Rolling With Advantage: Volunteer as a pencil and paper RPG game master for at risk youths.

## What is your project concept or idea? What challenge or opportunity will it solve?

Rolling with Advantage is a Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) inspired social project that seeks to facilitate the collaborative play of pencil and paper role playing games (RPGs) between at risk youths, in places like juvenile detention centers, and volunteer game masters (GMs). "Rolling With Advantage", is inspired by the DnD 5th Edition rule where players with "advantage" can roll twice instead of once and take the roll with the higher value. We think this is a great metaphor for second chances needed for at risk youth.

Pencil and paper RPGs like DnD may seem like wastes of time on the surface, but they are effective tools for teaching improvisation, cooperation, problem solving, and storytelling -- important skills for at risk youth populations. On top of all of those benefits it is a fun and fulfilling pastime that sparks the imagination and creates an interactive universe where almost anything can happen within the context of the game's rules.

RWA  would like to find a way to match up willing volunteer game masters with facilities in need of support.  We believe it is essential to make a service that allows for facilities to request a game master to volunteer their time and, likewise, provide a point of entry for game masters that want to volunteer their time. There would ideally be a website and/or app that connects conveniently to social media platforms.

## Who will benefit from your project? Describe the humans at the center of the problem - who are they?

Populations of at risk youth will benefit from RWA. This could include young people in juvenile detention centers or mental health facilities. The concept could be further expanded to other arenas including after school programs, hospitals, or senior facilities.

### How would they benefit? Can you tell their story?

The at risk young people would benefit from the socialization, improvisation, problem solving, and storytelling skills that pencil and paper RPGs help to foster. This will give these youths an avenue for self expression and imagination in facilities that often have few outlets for these skills. In addition, itâ€™s just fun!

### Do you have photos of them? Or quotes?

At this time no. We are still in a conceptual stage. Also, since this project deals with at risk youth, we would want to preserve their privacy.

## Issue area(s) relevant to your project idea:

- Children & Youth
- Education
- Health
- Neighborhoods

## What is the current state of your project idea?

RWA is currently in the conceptual stage of a solution, but we have not yet prototyped or tested it.

## Tell us more about the current state of your project idea.

We tried to do a grass roots version of this idea via Reddit and Facebook and got zero traction. We think there needs to be a bigger service/organization surrounding this idea to validate it and simplify matching up facilities in need of volunteers and Game Masters in the area.

### Do you have any links to news articles, text, mockups, code, or data?

RWA has some social media and online presence.

We have made a very rough framework of what we think a website of this nature could be.

### What is your background? Why is this challenge important to you?

Phillip was listening to a podcast and at some point they were discussing prisons that are involved in book donation programs and that a good deal of prisoners were asking for Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) books. A light bulb above his head turned on, and he thought what if there was some sort of organization that more or less facilitated this sort of volunteer work with pencil and paper RPGs.

### Are you representing a group in submitting this project idea?

Yes, Rolling with Advantage.
